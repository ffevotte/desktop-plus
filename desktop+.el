;;; Commentary:

;;     `desktop+' extends `desktop' by providing more features related to
;;     sessions persistance.

;; Centralized directory storing all desktop sessions:
;;
;;     Instead of relying on Emacs' starting directory to choose the session
;;     Emacs restarts, two functions are provided to manipulate sessions by
;;     name.
;;
;;     `desktop+-create': create a new session and give it a name.
;;
;;     `desktop+-load': change the current session; the new session to be loaded
;;          is identified by its name, as given during session creation using
;;          `desktop-create'.
;;
;;     The currently active session is identified in the title bar.  You can
;;     customize `desktop+-frame-title-function' to change the way the active
;;     session is displayed.
;;
;;     All sessions managed this way are stored in the directory given by
;;     `desktop+-base-dir'.

;; Handling of special buffers:
;;
;;     Desktop sessions by default save only buffers associated to "real" files.
;;     Desktop+ extends this by handling also "special buffers", such as those
;;     in `compilation-mode' or `term-mode', or indirect buffers (aka clones).
